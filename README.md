# Approaching (Almost) Any Machine Learning Problem (AAAMLP)

AAAMLP is a book by Abhishek Thakur (quadruple Kaggle grandmaster). In this repository I have uploaded my notebooks (code and notes I have made with links to other relevant articles) as I work through this book. 

This does not replace buying the book and these are only my notes and code I have made as I have work thorough the book, but maybe some use to some as they also work through this book. 

Please visit Abhishek Thakur's page for more on the book: https://github.com/abhishekkrthakur/approachingalmost
